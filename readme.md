# Starfield Navigator

On 2022-06-12, Bethesda released the [first ingame footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmb2FJGvnAw) of **Starfield**. Around 13:30 in the video, the starmap is visible for ~6 seconds. That scene was used to track all visible stars and reconstruct their ingame position. The footage included seven named stars, three of them are real star systems (Sol, Alpha Centauri and Porrima). The real-life position of those stars were used to calibrate the reconstruction.

The Starfield Navigator is a small program uses that data in a couple of ways:

A couple of insights were gained from the data:
- Of the "over 100" stars announced for the final game, 75 were visible
- Of the seven labeled systems, three are real. Therefore it's likely that other real-life star systems are included in the game
- Using distance, position and color, at least three more real stars could be identified: Altair, Barnard and Sirius
- The reconstructed camera path showed no vertical movement. It's possible that star map navigation is constrained to left/right and front/back, just like it looked in the footage
- Of the 7 named systems in the trailer, the 5 leftmost ones had their name on the right side of the planet. The rightmost ones had their name on the left side. Barring other explanations, this might imply that the horizontal center of the map is somewhere between JAFFA and VOLII
- A jumprange of 24.6 LY is enough to reach every system in the observed map from every other system. Half of the ships shown during the ship-designer part in the showcase had such a range or higher
- The average distance to the nearest system is 8.8 LY

The visible map is mostly to the right of SOL. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaNwtw7bhyk), it says "Our game is set [...] in an area that extends outward from our solar system for approximately 50 light years". That weakly implies that sol is somewhat centered. This collides with the observed fact that we already saw stars pretty far out of a 50 LY sphere around sol. But while the video is official, it's pretty questionable overall: The video animation doesn't match what the spoken description. Also the settled systems are called an "area of **our** solar system", which almost certainly is not correct.
